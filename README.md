# apple-journal-converter
Converts Apple Journal exports into a responsive standard website that can be used with every browser. Geolocations are embedded into a open street map.

Just copy the script in the "AppleJournalEntries" folder and execute it. It will then create a folder next to the "AppleJournalEntries" folder called "Journal_PNG".

Disclaimer: The script was created using Gen-AI, so the code is not really beautiful but understandable.
